  abstract={The aim of structured optimization is to assemble a solution, using a given set of (possibly uncountably infinite) atoms, to fit a model to data. A two-stage algorithm based on gauge duality and bundle method is proposed. The first stage discovers the optimal atomic support for the primal problem by solving a sequence of approximations of the dual problem using a bundle-type method. The second stage recovers the approximate primal solution using the atoms discovered in the first stage. The overall approach leads to implementable and efficient algorithms for large problems.}

  abstract={This paper studies the behaviour of the stochastic subgradient descent (SSGD) method applied to over-parameterized nonsmooth optimization problems that satisfy an interpolation condition. By leveraging the composite structure of the empirical risk minimization problems, we prove that when interpolation holds, SSGD converges at the same rate as the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method applied to smooth problems. Our analysis provides a partial explanation for the empirical observation that sometimes SGD and SSGD behave similarly for training smooth and nonsmooth machine learning models. We also prove that the rates we derive are optimal for the subgradient method in the convex and interpolation setting.}

  abstract={We consider greedy coordinate descent (GCD) for composite problems with sparsity inducing regularizers, including 1-norm regularization and non-negative constraints. Empirical evidence strongly suggests that GCD, when initialized with the zero vector, has an implicit screening ability that usually selects at each iteration coordinates that at are nonzero at the solution. Thus, for problems with sparse solutions, GCD can converge significantly faster than randomized coordinate descent. We present an improved convergence analysis of GCD for sparse optimization, and a formal analysis of its screening properties. We also propose and analyze an improved selection rule with stronger ability to produce sparse iterates. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data support our analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed selection rule.},

  abstract={Structured optimization uses a prescribed set of atoms to assemble a solution that fits a model to data. Polarity, which extends the familiar notion of orthogonality from linear sets to general convex sets, plays a special role in a simple and geometric form of convex duality. This duality correspondence yields a general notion of alignment that leads to an intuitive and complete description of how atoms participate in the final decomposition of the solution. The resulting geometric perspective leads to variations of existing algorithms effective for large-scale problems. We illustrate these ideas with many examples, including applications in matrix completion and morphological component analysis for the separation of mixtures of signals.}

  abstract={Vertical federated learning (VFL) has attracted greater and greater interest since it enables multiple parties possessing non-overlapping features to strengthen their machine learning models without disclosing their private data and model parameters. Similar to other machine learning algorithms, VFL faces demands and challenges of fairness, i.e., the learned model may be unfairly discriminatory over some groups with sensitive attributes. To tackle this problem, we propose a fair VFL framework in this work. First, we systematically formulate the problem of training fair models in VFL, where the learning task is modelled as a constrained optimization problem. To solve it in a federated and privacy-preserving manner, we consider the equivalent dual form of the problem and develop an asynchronous gradient coordinate-descent ascent algorithm, where some active data parties perform multiple parallelized local updates per communication round to effectively reduce the number of communication rounds. The messages that the server sends to passive parties are deliberately designed such that the information necessary for local updates is released without intruding on the privacy of data and sensitive attributes. We rigorously study the convergence of the algorithm when applied to general nonconvex-concave min-max problems. We prove that the algorithm finds a Î´-stationary point of the dual objective in $O(\delta^{-4})$ communication rounds under mild conditions. Finally, the extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in training fair models.},

  abstract={Federated learning is an emerging decentralized machine learning scheme that allows multiple data owners to work collaboratively while ensuring data privacy. The success of federated learning depends largely on the participation of data owners. To sustain and encourage data owners' participation, it is crucial to fairly evaluate the quality of the data provided by the data owners and reward them correspondingly. Federated Shapley value, recently proposed by Wang et al. [Federated Learning, 2020], is a measure for data value under the framework of federated learning that satisfies many desired properties for data valuation. However, there are still factors of potential unfairness in the design of federated Shapley value because two data owners with the same local data may not receive the same evaluation. We propose a new measure called completed federated Shapley value to improve the fairness of federated Shapley value. The design depends on completing a matrix consisting of all the possible contributions by different subsets of the data owners. It is shown under mild conditions that this matrix is approximately low-rank by leveraging concepts and tools from optimization. Both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation verify that the proposed measure does improve fairness in many circumstances.}

Probabilistic error bounds are given on the accuracy with which this process approximates the individual signals. The theory of polar convolution of convex sets and gauge functions plays a central role in the analysis and solution process. If the measurements are random and the noise is bounded, this approach stably recovers low-complexity and mutually incoherent signals, with high probability and with optimal sample complexity. We develop an efficient algorithm, based on level-set and conditional-gradient methods, that solves the convex optimization problems with sublinear iteration complexity and linear space requirements.

While the simplex method is known to have the finite termination property under mild assumptions, the number of iterations until optimality largely depends on the choice of initial basis. Existing strategies for selecting an advanced initial basis are mostly rule-based. These rules usually require extensive expert knowledge and empirical study to develop. Yet, many of them fail to exhibit consistent improvement, even for LP problems that arise in a single application scenario. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach for initial basis selection. We employ graph neural networks as a building block and develop a model that attempts to capture the relationship between LP problems and their optimal bases. In addition, during the inference phase, we supplement the learning-based prediction with linear algebra tricks to ensure the validity of the generated initial basis. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy by extensively testing it with state-of-the-art simplex solvers, including the open-source solver HiGHS and the commercial solver OptVerse. Through these rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that our strategy achieves substantial speedup and consistently outperforms existing rule-based methods. Furthermore, we extend the proposed approach to generating restricted master problems for column generation methods and present encouraging numerical results.},

  abstract={Federated learning is a popular technology for training machine learning models on distributed data sources without sharing data. Vertical federated learning or feature-based federated learning applies to the cases that different data sources share the same sample ID space but differ in feature space. To ensure the data owners' long-term engagement, it is critical to objectively assess the contribution from each data source and recompense them accordingly. The Shapley value (SV) is a provably fair contribution valuation metric originated from cooperative game theory. However, computing the SV requires extensively retraining the model on each subset of data sources, which causes prohibitively high communication costs in federated learning. We propose a contribution valuation metric called vertical federated Shapley value (VerFedSV) based on SV. We show that VerFedSV not only satisfies many desirable properties for fairness but is also efficient to compute, and can be adapted to both synchronous and asynchronous vertical federated learning algorithms. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results verify the fairness, efficiency, and adaptability of VerFedSV.},

The framework trains a graph neural network to classify useful constraints for aggregation in CG cut generation. The ML-driven CG separator selectively focuses on a small set of impactful constraints, improving runtimes without compromising the strength of the generated cuts. Key to our approach is the formulation of a constraint classification task which favours sparse aggregation of constraints, consistent with empirical findings. This, in conjunction with a careful constraint labeling scheme and a hybrid of deep learning and feature engineering, results in enhanced CG cut generation across five diverse MILP benchmarks. On the largest test sets, our method closes roughly twice as much of the integrality gap as the standard CG method while running 40$% faster. This performance improvement is due to our method eliminating 75% of the constraints prior to aggregation.}

While prior works often adapted off-the-shelf encoders to retrieve examples dynamically, an inherent discrepancy exists in the representational capacities between the external retrievers and the LLMs. Further, optimizing the selection of examples is a non-trivial task, since there are no straightforward methods to assess the relative benefits of examples without performing pairwise inference. To address these shortcomings, we propose Detriever, a novel demonstration retrieval framework that learns a weighted combination of LLM hidden states, where rich semantic information is encoded. To train the model, we propose a proxy score that estimates the relative benefits of examples based on the similarities between output queries.

  abstract={Huawei Cloud users leverage LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) as an efficient and scalable method to fine-tune and customize large language models (LLMs) for application-specific needs. However, tasks that require complex reasoning or deep contextual understanding are often hindered by biases or interference from the base model when using typical decoding methods like greedy or beam search. These biases can lead to generic or task-agnostic responses from the base model instead of leveraging the LoRA-specific adaptations. In this paper, we introduce Contrastive LoRA Decoding (CoLD), a novel decoding framework designed to maximize the use of task-specific knowledge in LoRA-adapted models, resulting in better downstream performance. CoLD uses contrastive decoding by scoring candidate tokens based on the divergence between the probability distributions of a LoRA-adapted expert model and the corresponding base model. This approach prioritizes tokens that better align with the LoRA's learned representations, enhancing performance for specialized tasks. While effective, a naive implementation of CoLD is computationally expensive because each decoding step requires evaluating multiple token candidates across both models. To address this, we developed an optimized kernel for Huawei's Ascend NPU. CoLD achieves up to a 5.54% increase in task accuracy while reducing end-to-end latency by 28% compared to greedy decoding. This work provides practical and efficient decoding strategies for fine-tuned LLMs in resource-constrained environments and has broad implications for applied data science in both cloud and on-premises settings.}

In parallel, AI hardware is scaling up, with Huawei's CloudMatrix384 SuperPod offering hundreds of GB/s high-speed interconnects. Running large MoE models on SuperPod-scale hardware brings new challenges. It requires new execution models, scalable scheduling, efficient expert load balancing, and elimination of single points of failure. This paper presents xDeepServe, Huawei Cloud's LLM serving system designed for SuperPod-scale infrastructure. At its core is Transformerless, a disaggregated architecture that decomposes transformer models into modular units--attention, feedforward, and MoE--executed independently on NPUs connected via high-speed fabric. We implement this design in two forms: disaggregated prefill-decode and disaggregated MoE-attention. This fully disaggregated setup enables independent scaling of compute and memory without sacrificing performance. To support this architecture, we propose XCCL, a communication library that leverages CloudMatrix384's global shared memory to implement efficient point-to-point and all-to-all primitives.

Serving these fine-tuned models at scale is challenging: deploying merged models in isolation is prohibitively resource-hungry, while existing multi-adapter serving systems with LoRA-style additive updates are incompatible with ESFT's expert-oriented paradigm. We present ExpertWeave, a system that serves multiple ESFT adapters concurrently over a single shared MoE base model, drastically reducing the memory footprint and improving resource utilization. To seamlessly integrate into existing inference pipelines for MoE models with non-intrusive modifications and minimal latency overhead, ExpertWeave introduces a virtual-memory-assisted expert weight manager that co-locates base-model and adapter experts without incurring memory overhead from fragmentation, and a fused kernel for batched rerouting to enable lightweight redirection of tokens to the appropriate experts at runtime. Our evaluations show that ExpertWeave can simultaneously serve multiple adapters of a 16B MoE model on a single accelerator where the baseline runs out of memory, or provides up to 94x more KV cache capacity and achieves up to 18% higher throughput while using comparable resources, all without compromising model accuracy. ExpertWeave maintains low overhead even when scaling to 20 adapters, with a 4-11% latency increase compared with serving the base model alone. Source code will be released soon.}

  abstract={Modern large language model (LLM) serving systems face challenges from highly variable requests with diverse lengths, priorities, and stage-specific service-level objectives (SLOs). Meeting these requires real-time scheduling, rapid and cost-effective scaling, and support for both collocated and disaggregated Prefill/Decode (P/D) architectures. We present \textbf{HyperFlexis}, a unified LLM serving system that integrates algorithmic and system-level innovations to jointly optimize scheduling and scaling under multiple SLOs. It features a multi-SLO-aware scheduler that leverages budget estimation and request prioritization to ensure proactive SLO compliance for both new and ongoing requests. The system supports prefill- and decode-stage multi-SLO scheduling for P/D-disaggregated architectures and KV cache transfers. It also enables cost-effective scaling decisions, prefill-decode instance linking during scaling, and rapid P/D role transitions. To accelerate scaling and reduce cold-start latency, a device-to-device (D2D) weight transfer mechanism is proposed that lowers weight loading overhead by up to \textbf{19.39}. These optimizations allow the system to achieve up to \textbf{4.44} higher SLO attainment, \textbf{65.82\%} lower request latency, and cost parity with state-of-the-art baselines. The code will be released soon.}
