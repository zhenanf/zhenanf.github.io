I am currently a Staff Research Engineer at the Huawei Vancouver Research Center, where I focus on optimizing large language model (LLM) inference and deployment on Huawei’s CloudMatrix SuperPod (华为云超节点). My recent work centers on scaling LLM serving for SuperPod-scale infrastructure, addressing the challenges that arise when running mixture-of-experts (MoE) models such as DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen on hundreds of interconnected NPUs. We recently presented some of this work in our technical report, [xDeepServe: LLM Serving on SuperPod-Scale Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02520){:target="\_blank"}.

Prior to my current work on LLMs, I contributed to the design and development of [OptVerse(天筹求解器)](https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/modelarts/optverse.html){:target="\_blank"}, Huawei’s in-house large-scale optimization solver, focusing on algorithmic innovations and system-level integration for real-world optimization tasks in the cloud.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca){:target="\_blank"}, under the supervision of Prof. [Michael P. Friedlander](https://friedlander.io){:target="\_blank"}. My dissertation, [Duality in Structured and Federated Optimization: Theory and Applications](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0421272){:target="\_blank"}, developed new theoretical and algorithmic insights into large-scale structured and federated optimization, with applications in machine learning, data mining, and signal processing.
