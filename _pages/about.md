I am currently a Staff Research Engineer at the Huawei Vancouver Research Center, where I work on optimizing large language model (LLM) inference and deployment within the [Huawei AI CloudMatrix platform(华为云超节点)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20377){:target="\_blank"}. My recent research focuses on efficient LLM serving, with particular emphasis on multi-LoRA inference, disaggregated serving architectures, and SLO-aware scheduling algorithms for large-scale cloud environments.

Prior to my work on LLMs, I was actively involved in the design and development of [OptVerse(天筹求解器)](https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/modelarts/optverse.html){:target="\_blank"}, Huawei’s in-house large-scale optimization solver. My contributions centered on algorithmic innovations and system-level integration to support real-world optimization tasks in cloud-based applications.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca){:target="\_blank"}, under the supervision of Prof. [Michael P. Friedlander](https://friedlander.io){:target="\_blank"}. My doctoral research addressed large-scale structured optimization problems, with applications in machine learning, data mining, and signal processing.
