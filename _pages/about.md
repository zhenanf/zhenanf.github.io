I am a Senior Research Scientist at Huawei Vancouver Research Center, where I'm actively involved in developing the optimization solver, [OptVerse](https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/modelarts/optverse.html){:target="\_blank"}. Prior to this, I completed my PhD at [The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca){:target="\_blank"} under the supervision of Prof. [Michael P. Friedlander](https://friedlander.io){:target="\_blank"}, focusing on large-scale structured optimization problems in machine learning, data mining and signal processing.

Currently, my role at Huawei extends to contributing to the development of [Pangu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10845){:target="\_blank"}, Huawei's cutting-edge large language model. Concurrently, I am exploring innovative ways to utilize this large language model in operational research processes. A key aspect of my work is studying the integration of OptVerse with Pangu, an initiative that offers a unique intersection of machine learning and operations research, promising new possibilities in the field.
